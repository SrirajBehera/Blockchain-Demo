****** Go-Ethereum ******

STEPS TO REPLICATE THE ENVIRONMENT INTO LOCAL SYSTEM AND START MINING (UBUNTU 20.04)

1. Clone go-etherem repo from GitHub
2. Install go-lang
3. mkdir genesis in go-ethereum folder
4. touch genesis3.json in genesis folder and put the following content for genesis block(starting block)
{
  "config": {
        "chainId": 0,
        "homesteadBlock": 0,
        "eip155Block": 0,
        "eip158Block": 0
    },
  "alloc"      : {},
  "coinbase"   : "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty" : "0x00",
  "extraData"  : "",
  "gasLimit"   : "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce"      : "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash"    : "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash" : "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp"  : "0x00"
}

5. then cd (to get back to home) and run the following command to initialize the genesis block
	/home/path_to go-ethereum_folder/go-ethereum/build/bin/geth --datadir ~/ethereum/net3 init genesis/genesis3.json
6. now to start the blockchain at a specific TCP port, run the following command
	/home/path_to go-ethereum_folder/go-ethereum/build/bin/geth --datadir ~/ethereum/net3/ --networkid 3 console --port 30303
	default TCP port is 30303
7. When using first time, a new account has to be created by the following command
	personal.newAccount()
	It will ask for entering and conirming Passphrase and you need to keep it safe
8. Once account is created, mining can begin.
9. To start mining, miner.start() --> will take time to mine according to the difficulty set in the genesis file
	You can also put parameter as a number as to start mining in specified thread
10. To confirm if mining has started, eth.mining
11. To check the hashrate, eth.hashrate
12. To check the block, eth.blockNumber --> will tell at which block you are mining (for genesis block, it will show 0)
13. To get information of specific block, eth.getBlock() --> put number as parameter to get the info for the block
14. To stop mining, miner.stop()
15. To get a list of accounts, eth.accounts
16. To get a list of commands, type eth.
17. To remove the ethash, rm -rf $HOME/.ethash
18. To exit the geth console, type exit
