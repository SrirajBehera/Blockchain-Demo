****** Ethereum and Smart Contract Deployment ******

STEPS TO REPLICATE THE ENVIRONMENT INTO THE LOCAL SYSTEM AND USING BLOCK EXPLORER

1. Clone ethereum repo from GitHub in home
2. we need a test environment to run ethereum which can be done by ganache-cli (earlier it was testrpc but it is now deprecated)
	sudo npm install -g ganache-cli
3. To install some more local packages
	sudo npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
4. Run testrpc or ganache-cli (preffered) in the terminal
5. then open new terminal and clone block explorer repo
	https://github.com/etherparty/explorer
6. Now cd to explorer and run sudo npm start to start the local server which will help us keep track of the blockchain
7. This completes the local environment setup
8. Now to make smart contracts, Solidity is used and its IDE is Remix which is browser based IDE.
9. Compile the sol code using solidity compilers available in Remix IDE
10. Then change the website protocol from https to http
11. Then navigate to run and deploy tab and change the environment to Web3 Provider
12. Click the deploy button to deploy the smart contract into the test blockchain and make some interations with functions in Remix IDE to simulate transactions
13. We can check the blockchain in block-explorer and get information about each individual block.
14. A custom frontend can also be made for the same and we need to install web3 to local machine using
	sudo npm install --save ethereum/web3
